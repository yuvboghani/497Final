How to improve named entity recognition for low-resource languages?,"To address the challenge of NER in low-resource languages, we propose a multi-stage framework that leverages cross-lingual transfer, data augmentation, and meta-learning. First, we use multilingual pre-trained language models like XLM-RoBERTa to capture shared representations across high-resource and low-resource languages. We apply translation-based data augmentation, automatically translating labeled NER datasets from high-resource languages into the target low-resource language using neural machine translation systems. To mitigate noise introduced during translation, we apply adversarial training techniques that make the model robust to label inconsistencies. Further, we incorporate a meta-learning module that fine-tunes model parameters to quickly adapt to new languages or domains with very few annotated examples. We evaluate our system across multiple low-resource languages, using standard datasets such as WikiAnn and newly collected corpora, measuring improvements in F1 score and adaptability over baseline cross-lingual transfer methods."
How can we detect hallucinated content in language model outputs?,"We propose a hybrid verification system that combines natural language generation with external factual grounding to detect hallucinations in LLM outputs. Our approach begins by generating outputs using large-scale language models like GPT or T5. To validate these outputs, we retrieve supporting documents from a curated set of trusted knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, scientific corpora) using dense retrieval. We then use a natural language inference (NLI) model trained on fact-checking datasets (like FEVER and SciFact) to determine whether the retrieved evidence supports, contradicts, or is neutral to the generated content. We introduce a hallucination score by aggregating contradiction likelihoods and evidential absence across the output segments. The model is trained and evaluated on manually annotated hallucination datasets across multiple domains, including medical, scientific, and general knowledge."
How to automatically generate questions from scientific research papers?,"We present a transformer-based question generation system designed for academic texts, leveraging structural and semantic signals unique to scientific writing. First, we parse each paper into sections (e.g., abstract, methods, results) and extract key sentences using a citation-based importance scoring function. Using SciBERT embeddings, we represent each sentence and contextually identify potential answer spans. These pairs are fed into a fine-tuned T5 model, trained on a custom dataset derived from SciQ, MARCO, and manually annotated question-answer pairs from arXiv abstracts. To improve factual accuracy and domain relevance, we apply post-processing with a citation checker module that ensures the generated questions align with cited claims. Evaluation is conducted using BLEU, ROUGE, and a human judgment survey focused on scientific relevance and clarity."
How to summarize long-form scientific documents effectively?,"To improve long-form scientific summarization, we propose a hierarchical transformer framework that separates content extraction from abstraction. The first stage employs a sentence-level extractive module that selects key sections using TF-IDF-weighted graph attention mechanisms guided by citation frequency. These selected spans are then encoded using a segment-aware encoder that preserves section-level context (e.g., introduction, discussion). Finally, a BART-based decoder generates abstractive summaries while attending to structural cues such as headings, figures, and references. To address factual consistency, we integrate a citation verification layer that cross-checks summary content against referenced papers. Our dataset includes full-text papers from the S2ORC corpus paired with author-written abstracts and peer-review summaries. We evaluate using ROUGE, BERTScore, and factual consistency metrics."
How can we detect sarcasm in social media posts?,"We propose a multi-view sarcasm detection system that models both the semantic content and social context of a post. Our model consists of two branches: a content encoder and a context encoder. The content encoder uses RoBERTa embeddings fine-tuned on sarcasm detection datasets, capturing the linguistic nuances of ironic language. The context encoder processes user-level features, including posting history and follower networks, using graph neural networks to model behavioral patterns. We fuse the two branches with an attention-based fusion module that prioritizes sarcasm-relevant interactions between the textual and social signals. To evaluate, we collect a new benchmark dataset from Twitter and Reddit, annotated for sarcasm and accompanied by metadata. Performance is measured using F1 score, and ablation studies highlight the contributions of content vs. context modeling."
How to perform cross-domain sentiment analysis?,"We propose a domain-adaptive sentiment analysis framework that transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain using adversarial training and self-supervised learning. First, we pre-train a sentiment classifier on the source domain using a BERT encoder. To reduce domain discrepancy, we introduce a domain discriminator that encourages the shared encoder to produce domain-invariant representations through gradient reversal. Simultaneously, we employ masked language modeling and contrastive learning on the target domain to preserve domain-specific nuances. During inference, we apply entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling to refine predictions on target data. Our experiments span multiple domain pairs (e.g., electronics → books, movies → restaurant reviews), using Amazon Reviews and Yelp datasets. Metrics include accuracy, F1 score, and domain transfer robustness."
How to recognize semantic textual entailment in multilingual settings?,"To tackle semantic textual entailment (STE) across languages, we introduce a multilingual dual-encoder model trained with contrastive learning and auxiliary translation alignment tasks. Each sentence pair is encoded using a shared XLM-R encoder, producing language-agnostic embeddings. We introduce a multilingual alignment objective that minimizes the distance between semantically equivalent pairs while maximizing the gap between contradictory ones, across both same-language and cross-language pairs. We also use machine translation to generate additional aligned pairs, enriching the training set with parallel entailment examples. Our model is trained on a combination of XNLI, PAWS-X, and custom translated data. Evaluation is conducted on multilingual STE tasks, measuring accuracy, precision, and generalization to unseen languages."
How to generate fluent and accurate code comments from source code?,"We propose a code-aware comment generation framework that integrates structural code representation with pre-trained language modeling. We first parse source code into abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and represent them as graphs. These are processed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture control flow and structural dependencies. Simultaneously, the raw code is encoded with a code-specific transformer like CodeT5. The outputs of the GNN and transformer are fused using a cross-attention mechanism, feeding into a decoder trained to generate natural language comments. To enhance factual alignment, we introduce a dual loss: one optimizing generation quality (via teacher forcing) and one encouraging structural alignment between the AST and comment. We evaluate on CodeSearchNet and DocString benchmarks using BLEU, METEOR, and human fluency ratings."
How to detect stance in online debates?,"We develop a stance detection model that incorporates argument structure, discourse cues, and user identity. Each debate post is segmented into argumentative units using discourse parsing, and encoded using a BiLSTM with attention over argumentative markers (e.g., “however”, “therefore”). Simultaneously, user profiles are encoded using learned embeddings from posting histories. We model inter-post relationships using a graph attention network (GAT), where nodes represent posts and edges represent reply or quote relations. The final stance prediction is computed based on the combined content, user, and network signals. The model is trained and evaluated on datasets like IBM Debater, IAC 2.0, and Reddit threads. Performance is reported in terms of F1 and agreement with human-labeled stance annotations."
How to extract fine-grained emotions from conversational text?,"We propose a multi-task learning architecture for fine-grained emotion recognition in multi-turn conversations. Our model processes dialogue history using a hierarchical transformer where each utterance is encoded and passed to a context-level transformer. We incorporate emotion shifts between speakers using a speaker-aware attention mechanism. Additionally, we train the model to jointly predict emotion categories and emotion intensity scores using two output heads. To enhance generalizability, we pre-train the model on large-scale emotion-labeled corpora (e.g., GoEmotions), followed by fine-tuning on conversation-specific datasets like DailyDialog and MELD. Evaluation includes accuracy, F1 score per class, and emotion trajectory analysis across conversations."
How to detect bias in language model outputs?,"We introduce a bias detection framework that analyzes generated outputs for social, gender, and racial bias through a combination of linguistic probes and knowledge graph alignment. First, we generate outputs using popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA) on standardized prompts related to occupations, nationalities, and identity descriptors. These outputs are parsed into structured triples and compared with neutral facts from external knowledge bases such as Wikidata. Simultaneously, we apply sentence-level bias classifiers trained on datasets like WinoBias and StereoSet to detect linguistic patterns indicative of bias. Our pipeline includes a counterfactual testing module where prompts are minimally altered (e.g., gender swap) to observe shifts in generated content. We quantify bias through semantic shift scores and factual divergence metrics, providing a comprehensive evaluation across domains."
How can we improve the interpretability of transformer models in NLP?,"We propose a layer-wise interpretability framework for transformer models that maps attention distributions to human-understandable rationales using concept activation vectors and intermediate representation probes. Each layer’s outputs are passed through linear probes trained to predict linguistic features (e.g., POS, NER, syntax). Attention heads are ranked by their correlation with these interpretable signals. We then compute attention-attribution scores to highlight input spans most influential to predictions, validated against human-annotated rationales in ERASER and CoS-E. Additionally, we introduce a visualization suite that renders layer-wise salience heatmaps and decision path trees, supporting step-by-step interpretability for model predictions. The effectiveness is assessed through expert evaluations and benchmarked on GLUE and SQuAD with explanation fidelity scores."
How to identify misinformation in news headlines and article summaries?,"We propose a misinformation detection model that combines factual verification with stylistic analysis. Given a headline and article summary, we first retrieve related documents using a dense passage retriever. A BERT-based entailment model assesses the factual support of claims made in the text. Parallel to this, a stylistic classifier trained on linguistic deception features (e.g., hyperbole, sentiment shifts, hedge words) evaluates writing patterns typical of misinformation. We ensemble both signals using a transformer-based gating mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate metadata features like domain reputation and author credibility using a knowledge graph of publishers. Evaluation is performed on datasets like LIAR, FNC, and COVIDLIES, reporting accuracy and F1 for multiple misinformation types."
How to train dialogue agents to express consistent personality traits?,"We develop a persona-aware dialogue generation framework that maintains consistency across multi-turn conversations. A pretrained conversational model like DialoGPT is conditioned on structured persona profiles, represented as a set of attribute sentences (e.g., ""I love painting,"" ""I have a cat""). During training, persona embeddings are fused into the decoder using memory-attention mechanisms. We introduce a persona consistency loss, which penalizes contradictions between generated utterances and the persona profile using a binary classifier trained on persona-switching examples. We also generate synthetic contradictory dialogues to augment the training set. The system is evaluated on PersonaChat and custom datasets with crowd-annotated consistency scores and BLEU for fluency."
How can NLP be used to automatically grade student essays?,"We propose a rubric-aware essay scoring system that combines textual coherence modeling, semantic relevance scoring, and discourse analysis. First, essays are segmented into discourse units using rhetorical structure theory. Each segment is encoded using a RoBERTa-based coherence model trained to score logical flow and argument progression. Semantic similarity between essay content and rubric expectations is computed using a dual encoder trained on aligned prompt-score pairs. Finally, we introduce a grading classifier that fuses discourse features with coherence and relevance scores, producing interpretable grade rationales. Evaluation is done on the ASAP and ERAS datasets with accuracy, quadratic weighted kappa, and explanation quality scores."
How to adapt pretrained language models to domain-specific terminology in biomedicine?,"We propose a continual pretraining pipeline that adapts general-purpose transformers to biomedical domains without catastrophic forgetting. Starting with BioBERT or PubMedBERT, we pretrain the model on recent domain-specific corpora using masked language modeling, while simultaneously applying elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to retain general language understanding. We introduce a terminology-alignment module using ontology mapping (e.g., UMLS, MeSH) to refine embeddings of biomedical terms. Downstream evaluation includes biomedical NER, relation extraction, and question answering on datasets like BC5CDR, BioRelEx, and BioASQ. We compare against baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptation methods using precision, recall, and F1 metrics."
How to use NLP for detecting mental health signals in online text?,"We develop a mental health signal detection system that integrates linguistic cues, temporal patterns, and psychological lexicons. Posts from Reddit and mental health forums are encoded using a transformer model augmented with LIWC features and emotion embeddings from Empath. We train the model using multi-label classification to predict mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, and self-harm. A temporal attention module captures posting patterns over time, flagging sudden shifts in sentiment or activity. For interpretability, we extract contributing keywords and align them with DSM-based symptom descriptions. Evaluation is performed on CLPsych and RSDD datasets, reporting precision, recall, and early-warning detection scores."
How to perform joint extraction of entities and relations from scientific abstracts?,"We propose a span-based joint extraction model that identifies both entities and their relations using a shared contextual representation. Abstracts are tokenized and encoded using SciBERT, and candidate entity spans are proposed using a span classification head. A second module predicts relations between span pairs using bilinear scoring with global attention. To model interdependencies between entities and relations, we incorporate a factor graph layer trained with structured learning. Additionally, we introduce a context-aware loss function that penalizes inconsistencies such as relation-only predictions without valid entities. We evaluate the model on SciERC and ChemProt datasets, measuring micro and macro F1 scores."
How to align multilingual knowledge graphs using text and structure?,"We propose a hybrid alignment framework that uses multilingual sentence embeddings and graph neural networks to align entities across knowledge graphs in different languages. Textual descriptions of entities are encoded using LaBSE or mBERT, while structural embeddings are learned through graph convolutional layers trained with neighborhood aggregation. Alignment candidates are generated by computing cosine similarity across both embeddings and filtered using a mutual nearest neighbor strategy. A self-training loop refines alignments over time using confident matches. Evaluation is done on DBP15K and WK3l-60K multilingual datasets using hit@1, hit@5, and MRR metrics."
How to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for accented English?,"We propose a robust ASR training pipeline that incorporates accent-aware acoustic modeling and adversarial adaptation. First, we collect a balanced corpus of accented English speech using datasets like Common Voice, L2-ARCTIC, and accented TED talks. The acoustic model is initialized with wav2vec 2.0 and fine-tuned with an accent classifier trained to differentiate regional accents. We then apply domain-adversarial training to encourage accent-invariant feature extraction. To further boost performance, we synthesize accented speech using voice conversion and augment the training set. Evaluation is done across American, Indian, British, and African English accents, using WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate) metrics."
How to detect implicit bias in NLP datasets used for sentiment analysis?,"We propose a framework that uncovers implicit bias in sentiment analysis datasets by introducing a bias detection pipeline composed of two components: demographic probing and semantic polarity mapping. The system first tags text instances with inferred demographic indicators using an auxiliary classifier. Next, a sentiment polarity scorer identifies statistical disparities in label distribution across these groups. We then apply counterfactual data augmentation by generating minimally edited sentences that swap demographic references to balance the dataset. An adversarial training strategy is introduced to mitigate the influence of protected attributes. Our framework is evaluated using standard sentiment models trained on biased vs. debiased datasets, with metrics that assess fairness, classification accuracy, and representation parity. Human evaluators also provide qualitative feedback on model behavior in edge cases, ensuring transparency. This multi-step strategy aims to reduce unintended bias propagation in downstream applications."
How can NLP models be trained to explain their predictions in natural language?,"We develop an explainable NLP architecture that jointly generates predictions and human-readable rationales. The model consists of two interconnected modules: a task-specific predictor and a rationale generator. During training, the model learns to identify influential tokens using gradient-based attribution methods, then uses these tokens as input to a decoder that constructs natural language explanations. To ensure explanations align with model reasoning, we introduce a “faithfulness loss” that penalizes rationales inconsistent with attention patterns or attribution scores. Additionally, the rationale module is pretrained on existing explanation datasets such as e-SNLI and fine-tuned for the target domain. We evaluate the model using three criteria: fluency (via BLEU and ROUGE), faithfulness (via leave-one-out sensitivity tests), and human trust (through user studies). This approach provides interpretable NLP systems that increase transparency and user confidence in model predictions."
How to generate accurate code documentation using NLP techniques?,"We present a documentation generation system that combines structural code analysis with transformer-based language modeling. Our model takes source code as input and first parses it into an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST is then embedded using a graph neural network to capture structural and semantic dependencies. A pre-trained code-specific transformer such as CodeT5 decodes this representation into natural language documentation. To guide generation toward useful content, we incorporate reinforcement learning using rewards based on informativeness, clarity, and alignment with docstring standards. We train the model on open-source repositories containing code-comment pairs and evaluate it using BLEU, METEOR, and CodeBLEU. Human evaluators assess the factual correctness and relevance of the generated summaries. This approach bridges the gap between formal code semantics and readable documentation, especially for complex codebases and low-resource programming languages."
How to identify under-cited influential research papers using NLP?,"We propose a method to detect under-cited but influential scientific papers by modeling latent impact using content-driven and network-based signals. We first train a semantic encoder using SciBERT to embed research papers based on their abstract, title, and methods. We then compute expected citation counts using a predictive regression model that incorporates content embeddings, publication venue, and citation network centrality. Discrepancies between predicted and actual citations highlight potential under-citation. To validate influence, we analyze downstream papers that inherit methodologies or datasets from the under-cited paper. A domain-adaptive classifier also identifies papers that introduce novel ideas with limited immediate recognition. We evaluate using retrospective citation data and expert judgments from domain researchers. This framework enables academic search engines and funding agencies to surface impactful research that may be overlooked due to citation lag or field fragmentation."
How to personalize language generation in educational applications?,"We introduce a personalized language generation framework for educational applications that adapts output to the learner’s proficiency level, interests, and prior knowledge. Each learner is represented by a dynamic profile embedding generated from their reading history, comprehension scores, and quiz performance. This embedding conditions a fine-tuned T5 model that generates tailored outputs for reading comprehension, vocabulary reinforcement, and summarization tasks. To support style and tone adaptation, we incorporate a content simplification module guided by readability metrics and psycholinguistic features. The system is trained on educational datasets annotated with learner proficiency levels and is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning based on learner engagement and improvement scores. Evaluation includes both automatic metrics (e.g., readability, BLEU) and user feedback on clarity, engagement, and perceived helpfulness. This approach fosters deeper learning through tailored content delivery in intelligent tutoring systems."
How to automatically identify scientific controversies using NLP?,"We develop a pipeline to detect scientific controversies by analyzing conflicting claims in academic literature. First, we apply named entity and claim detection models to extract core scientific assertions. We then train a stance classifier to identify agreement, disagreement, or neutrality between pairs of claims. These relationships are encoded into a controversy graph, where nodes represent claims and edges represent stance relations. Temporal citation trends and polarity scores help prioritize evolving disputes. Additionally, topic modeling and clustering identify domains with concentrated disagreement. To validate our method, we compare detected controversies with expert-annotated debates in biomedical and climate science fields. The system is further refined using human-in-the-loop feedback to improve stance detection accuracy. This work enables better understanding of disagreement dynamics in science and could support evidence synthesis in policy and systematic review contexts."
How to evaluate the consistency of large language models across prompt rewordings?,"We introduce a novel framework to assess the consistency of LLMs when answering semantically equivalent but lexically diverse prompts. A set of paraphrased prompts is generated using a controlled paraphrase model that ensures semantic preservation while varying syntax, structure, and lexical choice. The language model is evaluated across this set for answer stability, rationale similarity, and prediction confidence. We define a consistency index that integrates output agreement, token-level overlap, and explanation coherence. To identify causes of inconsistency, we analyze attention patterns and token saliency across prompts. We test this approach on multiple QA and reasoning benchmarks and compare different LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude, and open-source variants. Our framework exposes robustness gaps and highlights the need for training objectives that reinforce semantic invariance under prompt perturbation."
How can NLP systems assist in detecting and correcting scientific writing errors for non-native speakers?,"We propose a grammar-aware rewriting system tailored to the needs of non-native English-speaking researchers. Our system consists of a three-part architecture: an error classifier, an error type tagger, and a sentence rewriter. The error classifier flags candidate sentences with structural or lexical issues using syntactic and discourse features. A multi-class tagger identifies specific error types such as verb tense, article usage, or cohesion problems. These annotations are fed into a BART-based rewriter fine-tuned on aligned pairs of original and corrected scientific text from peer review platforms. We incorporate feedback from native-speaking editors to calibrate suggestions for academic tone. Evaluation is based on error coverage, grammaticality, and human preference in double-blind comparisons. The system can be deployed as a writing assistant to support equitable access to scientific publication for multilingual authors."
How to automatically discover implicit assumptions in machine learning papers?,"We design an NLP system to identify and surface implicit assumptions made in ML research. First, we use a SciBERT-based classifier to identify text spans that signal claims, methods, or limitations. An entailment model is then applied to infer unstated preconditions and contextual dependencies. To support domain specificity, we fine-tune on annotated corpora of methodological assumptions and incorporate knowledge graphs for domain constraints. We also construct a semantic contrast model that compares proposed methods with baseline assumptions to detect deviations or oversights. Output assumptions are ranked by novelty and relevance using citation context analysis. A user interface presents assumptions alongside original text for"
How to detect and prevent hallucinations in scientific text generated by language models?,"We propose a hallucination detection and mitigation framework tailored for scientific text generation. Our system consists of a two-stage pipeline: a factuality verifier and a guided decoder. The verifier uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to compare generated claims with a curated corpus of scientific literature. Claims not supported by retrieved evidence are flagged as hallucinations. For prevention, we incorporate constrained decoding using citation-aware prompts and knowledge-grounded attention layers. The model is trained with a loss function that penalizes unsupported statements while rewarding accurate citations. We use datasets such as SciFact and generate synthetic hallucinations to augment training. Evaluation includes precision of fact verification, citation accuracy, and human-rated factual consistency. This approach is critical for improving trustworthiness and accountability in scientific LLM applications."
How can LLMs be aligned with ethical principles in sensitive NLP tasks like mental health support?,"We develop an alignment framework for LLMs used in mental health applications, ensuring they adhere to ethical norms such as empathy, harm reduction, and informed response. The approach uses a dual-objective fine-tuning method: first, we train on therapeutic dialogue datasets annotated with expert-rated empathy and safety scores; second, we employ reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to tune outputs toward ethical and emotionally appropriate responses. A rule-based safety monitor flags risky suggestions, and a persona calibration module ensures consistency in tone and advice. We evaluate the system using clinical relevance metrics, user trust scores, and expert reviews. This alignment framework aims to ensure that mental health-focused NLP systems are both helpful and responsible, especially in high-stakes settings."
How to model inter-sentential reasoning for multi-hop question answering in long documents?,"We propose a hierarchical reasoning framework for multi-hop question answering that models cross-sentence dependencies in long documents. Our system first segments the document into semantic chunks and encodes each with a contextualized encoder such as Longformer. A graph-based reasoning module constructs inter-sentential links by detecting coreference chains, discourse relations, and temporal cues. Multi-hop paths are then extracted using a graph traversal algorithm that identifies logical reasoning chains. An attention-based aggregator selects and fuses information from relevant paths before generating an answer. The model is trained on datasets like HotpotQA and QAngaroo, with additional supervision from synthetic chain-of-thought annotations. We evaluate performance on logical consistency, accuracy, and answer traceability. This framework enhances explainability and robustness in complex QA tasks."

The system decomposes stories into events, entities, and temporal segments using semantic role labeling and event extraction. A coherence graph is built where nodes represent events and edges reflect causal, temporal, or referential links. Graph neural networks are used to score connectivity and consistency. A second module measures discourse-level signals such as lexical cohesion and topic continuity using BERT embeddings. We train on annotated story datasets like ROCStories and WritingPrompts, evaluating against human coherence judgments.

First, we classify paper sections into discipline-aligned topics using zero-shot topic models and pre-defined ontology labels (e.g., MeSH, ACM). We compute a diversity score based on entropy over topic distributions and cross-field citation patterns. A graph attention network identifies semantic overlap between papers in disparate disciplines, inferring influence beyond citation counts. To capture conceptual transfer, we analyze terminology evolution using diachronic embeddings. Our model is validated using case studies of transformative papers known for bridging disciplines. Metrics include influence prediction accuracy and expert evaluation of interdisciplinary novelty. This method helps funding bodies and reviewers recognize broad scientific impact."
How to detect and mitigate dataset leakage in NLP benchmarks?,"We present a leakage detection framework that identifies unintended data overlaps in NLP benchmark datasets.

First, we fine-tune a LegalBERT model on a corpus of annotated legal texts across domains like contracts, litigation, and regulations. To introduce transparency, we use attention visualization and extract attention-weighted tokens as legal ""evidence spans."" Then, we use a rule induction module trained via decision trees on embeddings of these spans to produce human-readable logic rules. Judges and legal experts can trace model decisions back to phrases and legal principles, improving trust and acceptance. We evaluate the system on classification accuracy, rationale alignment with legal annotations, and user studies with law professionals. This approach strikes a balance between model performance and interpretability in high-stakes domains."
How to detect stylistic plagiarism in academic writing using NLP?,"We propose a stylistic plagiarism detection system that captures subtle rephrasings and tone-level mimicry in academic texts. The system uses stylometric features such as sentence rhythm, function word frequency, lexical richness, and syntactic construction patterns to learn an author's unique writing style. A dual encoder model compares the suspected document with a reference corpus to identify stylistic convergence using cosine similarity in the stylistic embedding space. Unlike traditional content-matching, this method targets writing behavior. Training data is created by rephrasing academic texts through controlled paraphrasing tools. Evaluation is based on F1 for true plagiarism detection and expert assessments of stylistic similarity. This solution provides an effective layer of detection for modern forms of plagiarism that evade standard tools."
